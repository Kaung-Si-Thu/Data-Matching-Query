Data matching process 

1. Check Existing Data with New Incoming Data
Objective: Compare new data against an existing dataset.
Approach:
Data Load: Load both existing data and new incoming data into your environment (e.g., SQL database, Python, Excel).
Data Cleaning: Ensure both datasets are cleaned and pre-processed (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
Join/Comparison: Use appropriate methods (e.g., SQL JOIN, Python merge function) to compare datasets based on matching criteria.
2. Define Matching Level by Criteria
Objective: Establish different levels of matching (e.g., exact match, partial match).
Approach:
Exact Match: Match records where all defined fields (e.g., name, email, ID) are identical.
Partial Match: Implement fuzzy matching or partial matching on certain fields (e.g., name similarity, approximate date).
Thresholds: Set thresholds for match confidence, especially for partial matches.
3. Extract the Matched Data According to the Level
Objective: Extract the records that meet the matching criteria.
Approach:
Subset Extraction: Use filtering techniques to extract matched records at different levels of confidence.
Tagging: Add a column or flag in the data to indicate the match level (e.g., 'Exact Match', 'Partial Match').
4. Update the Matched Data as "Already Extracted"
Objective: Mark matched records to prevent duplicate processing.
Approach:
Flagging: Update the matched records with a status field (e.g., extracted = TRUE).
Database/Spreadsheet Update: If using a database, update the status field; if using a spreadsheet, update a specific column.
5. Check Daily for New Matched Data by Query Schedule
Objective: Automate the process to check for new matches daily.
Approach:
Scheduling: Use cron jobs (Linux), Task Scheduler (Windows), or a scheduling tool (e.g., Apache Airflow) to run the matching process daily.
Incremental Matching: Implement logic to only check new or unprocessed data against existing records.
6. Send the Email with Excel File to Respective Stakeholders
Objective: Notify stakeholders with the results.
Approach:
Report Generation: Generate an Excel report of matched records.
Email Automation: Use email automation tools (e.g., Python smtplib, Power Automate) to send the Excel file to the respective stakeholders.
Dynamic Email Content: Personalize email content based on match level or other relevant data.
